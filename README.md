# Opacity-on-TLPN

It is a supplementary instruction for the paper "Symbolic Observer of Timed Labeled Petri Nets With Application to Current-state Opacity".

In the paper, we define three operations about multi-valued decision diagrams (MDDs) and matrix diagrams: union of two MDDs, union of two matrix diagrams, and relational 
product of an MDD and a matrix diagram (Please see Definitions 8, 9, and 10 of the paper).

We provide a text file "Interpretation of the operations about MDDs and matrix diagrams.pdf" to detail those three definitions through examples.
