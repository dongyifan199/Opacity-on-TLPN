# State Estimation in TLPN
Intro
----
This is a supplementary instruction for the paper "Symbolic State Estimation in Bounded Timed Labeled Petri".

The file named "Preliminary of Petri nets" shows some basic notations about Petri nets.

The document entitled "Additional_Definitions_and_Examples.pdf" contains three definitions of the operations about multi-valued decision diagrams (MDDs) and matrix diagrams (union of two MDDs, union of two matrix diagrams, and relational product of an MDD and a matrix diagram) and some results of examples in the paper.

We provide the text file "Operations of MDDs and matrix diagrams.pdf" to detail those three definitions through examples.
