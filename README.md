# State Estimation in TLPN
Intro
----
This is a supplementary instruction for the paper "Symbolic State Estimation in Bounded Timed Labeled Petri Nets".

The document entitled "Additional Definitions and Examples" contains three definitions of the operations about multi-valued decision diagrams (MDDs) and matrix diagrams (union of two MDDs, union of two matrix diagrams, and relational product of an MDD and a matrix diagram) and some results of examples in the paper.

We provide the text file "Operations of MDDs and Matrix Diagrams" to detail those three definitions through examples.
