# Opacity-on-TLPN
Intro
----
This is a supplementary instruction for the paper "Symbolic Observer of Timed Labeled Petri Nets With Application to Current-state Opacity".

The document entitled "Additional_Definitions_and_Examples.pdf" contains three definitions of the operations about multi-valued decision diagrams (MDDs) and matrix diagrams (union of two MDDs, union of two matrix diagrams, and relational product of an MDD and a matrix diagram) and some results of examples in the paper.

We provide the text file "Operations of MDDs and matrix diagrams.pdf" to detail those three definitions through examples.
